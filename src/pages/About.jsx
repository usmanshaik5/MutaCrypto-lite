                Our Founding Story
              </h1>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                Our journey began with a simple yet profound mission: to enhance
                exam preparation and academic support for students at LNMIIT. As
                we navigated the demands and pressures of exam times, we
                recognized a common challenge among our peersâ€” the need for
                accessible, peer-driven educational resources. In response, we
                envisioned a platform designed specifically for our university
                community. We wanted to create a space where students could
                share their insights and knowledge through video content,
                helping one another understand complex topics and excel in their
                studies.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                Our platform allows any LNMIIT student to upload videos
                explaining various lectures and topics, creating a rich
                repository of resources tailored to our unique curriculum. By
                fostering collaboration and peer-to-peer teaching, we aim to
                support each student's learning journey and make exam
                preparation more effective and engaging. Our mission is to
                bridge the gap between individual learning needs and the
                collective knowledge within our university, empowering every
                student to succeed and thrive.
